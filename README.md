# housify-challenges

- The biggest challenge in my Housify (MERN) hotel booking platform was ensuring real-time room availability when multiple users attempted to book the same property simultaneously.

- I solved this by implementing MongoDB transaction-based booking logic, ensuring atomic updates and preventing double bookings.

- Another challenge was integrating secure authentication and role-based access control using Auth0 while keeping the login flow smooth and user-friendly.

- Optimizing the property search and filtering system—including price ranges, dates, and amenities—required designing efficient MongoDB indexes and debounced API requests.

- I also handled complex UI state management in React, especially syncing booking details, availability checks, and user sessions in real time.

- These problems helped me design a scalable, production-ready architecture that maintains data integrity and delivers a fast user experience.
